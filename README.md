## 🧭 Game Overview

You play as an explorer trapped in a pitch-black cave. You can't see — you must rely on **sound pulses** to briefly reveal the surrounding cave walls and obstacles, simulating **echolocation**. Navigate carefully, avoid hazards, and try to escape the depths.

The game is built using the **iGraphics** graphics library in the **C programming language**.
